## Try not to use IP address and port number. Also, try not to use the application layer data payload content. - GANG 
### TO DO  
Look into classic classification models, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), basic neural netrowks 
play with wireshark
Data collection through public data sets, or manually

# Info
I made the SVM changes to the quinn_SVM branch in file data_processing_svm.ipynb, the changes made to data_processing.ipynb should be ignored lol
